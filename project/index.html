        <h3>A Brief History of World Coinage<a id="ref" href="sources.html"><sup>[1]</sup></a></h3>

        <p>The history of coins stretches back to the first millennium BC/BCE. Notable early examples of coins include
            the Lydian Lion coins, Persian daric and siglos, Tong Bei, the dirham and gold dinar.

            Coins are a major archaeological source of history. Coins convey information about language, administration,
            religion, economic conditions, and the ruler who minted those coins.</p>

        <p>Some of the most famous and widely collected coins of antiquity are Roman coins and Greek coins.
            A tomb of the Chinese Shang dynasty dating back to the 11th century BCE shows what may be the first cast
            copper
            money Tong Bei.
            Silver and gold coins are the most common and universally recognized throughout history, even today. Mints
            around the world still make millions of gold and silver coins, including the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf, the
            American Gold Eagle, and the Australian Nugget.
            Copper, nickel, and other metals are also common, but in lower denominations.

            <h3>History of Coins in the United States<a id="ref" href="sources.html"><sup>[2]</sup></a></h3>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>The story of U.S. coins began before the Mint's establishment in 1792, with a mix of foreign and
                    colonial
                    coins circulating during the Colonial Period and after the Revolutionary War. Spanish milled dollars
                    were
                    popular due to consistent silver content, and people cut coins into fractions for change. After the
                    Revolutionary War, the Articles of Confederation allowed each state to produce its own coins,
                    creating
                    confusion with differing values across states. In 1787, Congress authorized the production of copper
                    Fugio
                    cents, featuring a sundial and a chain of 13 links,
                    but the debate over national coinage continued after the Constitution was ratified in 1788.</p>
                <p>The Coinage Act of 1792 established a national mint in Philadelphia and introduced decimal
                    coinage
                    based
                    on the Spanish milled dollar. The U.S. minted copper, silver, and gold coins, including half cents,
                    cents,
                    half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, dollars, and gold quarter eagles, half eagles, and
                    eagles. In
                    1792, 1,500 silver half dimes were made but not circulated. The first circulating coins, 11,178
                    copper
                    cents, were released in 1793. These cents were criticized for their large size and controversial
                    design,
                    leading to a quick redesign. Foreign coins were temporarily allowed to circulate until the Mint
                    could
                    meet
                    demand.</p>
                <p>The Mint struggled to produce enough coins, with copper cents being stable but insufficient due
                    to
                    rising copper costs. In 1857, the half cent was discontinued, and the cent was made smaller. Silver
                    and
                    gold
                    coins began production in 1794 and 1795, but they did not circulate initially due to an unfavorable
                    silver-to-gold ratio, leading to exports and melting of U.S. coins. Banks supplied precious metals
                    and
                    preferred large denominations, leaving smaller silver coins like half dimes, dimes, and quarters
                    scarce.
                    Various Acts helped improve coin production, and by 1857, Congress banned foreign coins as legal
                    tender.</p>

                <p>The Coinage Act of 1792 required coins to feature "LIBERTY" and the year on the obverse, and for
                    gold
                    and silver coins to have an eagle and "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" on the reverse. Copper coins only
                    had
                    the
                    denomination on the reverse, with a wreath becoming the standard design. Later Acts changed the
                    inscriptions
                    and designs we see on coins today.</p>
