        <br>
        <p>The study or collection of coins, paper currency, an medals. </p>

        <h3>A Brief History of World Coinage<a id="ref" href="sources.html">[1]</a></h3>
        <br>
        <p>The history of coins stretches back to the first millennium BC/BCE. Notable early examples of coins include
            the Lydian Lion coins, Persian daric and siglos, Tong Bei, the dirham and gold dinar.

            Coins are a major archaeological source of history. Coins convey information about language, administration,
            religion, economic conditions, and the ruler who minted those coins.</p>
        <br>
        Some of the most famous and widely collected coins of antiquity are Roman coins and Greek coins.
        A tomb of the Chinese Shang dynasty dating back to the 11th century BCE shows what may be the first cast copper
        money Tong Bei.
        Silver and gold coins are the most common and universally recognized throughout history, even today. Mints
        around the world still make millions of gold and silver coins, including the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf, the
        American Gold Eagle, and the Australian Nugget.
        Copper, nickel, and other metals are also common, but in lower denominations.

        <h3>History of Coins in the United States<a id="ref" href="sources.html">[2]</a></h3>
        <br>
        <p>The story of U.S. coins began before the Mint's establishment in 1792, with a mix of foreign and colonial
            coins circulating during the Colonial Period and after the Revolutionary War. Spanish milled dollars were
            popular due to consistent silver content, and people cut coins into fractions for change. After the
            Revolutionary War, the Articles of Confederation allowed each state to produce its own coins, creating
            confusion with differing values across states. In 1787, Congress authorized the production of copper Fugio
            cents, featuring a sundial and a chain of 13 links,
            but the debate over national coinage continued after the Constitution was ratified in 1788.
            <br>The Coinage Act of 1792 established a national mint in Philadelphia and introduced decimal coinage based
            on the Spanish milled dollar. The U.S. minted copper, silver, and gold coins, including half cents, cents,
            half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, dollars, and gold quarter eagles, half eagles, and eagles. In
            1792, 1,500 silver half dimes were made but not circulated. The first circulating coins, 11,178 copper
            cents, were released in 1793. These cents were criticized for their large size and controversial design,
            leading to a quick redesign. Foreign coins were temporarily allowed to circulate until the Mint could meet
            demand.
            <br>The Mint struggled to produce enough coins, with copper cents being stable but insufficient due to
            rising copper costs. In 1857, the half cent was discontinued, and the cent was made smaller. Silver and gold
            coins began production in 1794 and 1795, but they did'â€™t circulate initially due to an unfavorable
            silver-to-gold ratio, leading to exports and melting of U.S. coins. Banks supplied precious metals and
            preferred large denominations, leaving smaller silver coins like half dimes, dimes, and quarters scarce.
            Various Acts helped improve coin production, and by 1857, Congress banned foreign coins as legal tender.
            
            <br>The Coinage Act of 1792 required coins to feature "LIBERTY" and the year on the obverse, and for gold
            and silver coins to have an eagle and "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA" on the reverse. Copper coins only had the
            denomination on the reverse, with a wreath becoming the standard design. Later Acts changed the inscriptions
            and designs we see on coins today.
